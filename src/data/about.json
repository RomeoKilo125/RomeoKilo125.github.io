  "name": "About",
  "bio": "I am a software developer with a proven record. For the first twelve years of my career, I built and maintained a library of full-stack applications and scripted automation tools for Windstream Communications. For the past two, I have been crafting the user experience as a front-end engineer for Bank of America and bringing new devs online with the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania. I enjoy making something out of nothing. The endless possibilities of an empty editor always inspire me. My strengths lie in the communication of complex topics and QA testing. But I mostly enjoy creating things that ease people's lives and maybe make them a little more fun.",
