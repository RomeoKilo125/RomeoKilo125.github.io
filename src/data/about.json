  "name": "About",
  "bio": "I am a software developer with a proven record. For the first twelve years of my career, I created and maintained a large library of tools including full stack applications and scripted automation tools for a telecom; and for the past two, I’m crafting the user experience for a major financial institution. I really enjoy making something out of nothing. The endless possibilities of an empty editor always inspire me. My strengths lie in the communication of complex topics and QA testing. But I really enjoy creating things that make people’s lives easier, and maybe a little more fun.",
